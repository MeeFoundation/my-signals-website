  ##### **MySignals is a handshake process between your agent and a service provider website/app.**
  It's an extensible communications framework that allows developers to define specific kinds of signals (signaltypes) that can be exchanged. It defines a common namespace for these signaltypes and a syntax for passing parameters. During this handshake each side conveys the signaltypes it supports.
  
  |    **Signal**    |  **Description** |
  | :----------: | :----------: |
  | **Privacy**  | Proffer your legally binding notice to the service provider that it must respect your right that they “Do Not Sell” your personal information. MySignals provides an alternate implementation of the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/).  |
  |  **MyTerms** | Proffer, negotiate and digitally sign mutually acceptable contracts related to privacy and data sharing using [IEEE 7012](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/7012/7192/).|
  | **AgeProtect** | Request an age-appropriate experience from the service provider, and proffer your age verification and consent management endpoints. |
  | **Identity** | Tell the service provider who you are. Give them a (self-sovereign) digital identifier.  |
  | **KERI-AID** | Proffer your KERI Autonomic identifier. |
  | **IdP** | Proffer the IdP(s) (identity provider(s)) you use.  This solves the [NASCAR](https://apicrazy.com/2014/07/22/nascar-problem-in-authorisation-server-selection/) problem. |
  | **SIOPv2** | Tell the service provider that your agent supports OpenID SIOPv2 allowing their site/app to display a “Continue with wallet” button for password-less login. |
