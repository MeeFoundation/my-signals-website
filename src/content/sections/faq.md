  - question: What is MySignals?
    answer: MySignals is a handshake process between a person's agent and a service provider website/app. It is an extensible communications framework that allows developers to define specific kinds of signals (signaltypes) that can be exchanged. It defines a common namespace for these signaltypes and a syntax for passing parameters. During this handshake each side conveys the signaltypes it supports.
  - question: Who is supporting the development of MySignals?
    answer: MySignals is a project of [The Mee Foundation](https://mee.foundation) in collaboration with [PRIVO](https://privo.com) and [Swift Invention](https://swiftinvention.com).
  - question: How can I get involved in developing the proposed spec?
    answer: You can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/7CWzNvmS) and submit PRs to our [Github](https://github.com/MeeFoundation/mysignals-website).
